//Collide Open Panel - Free version 1.1
//////

1.) Navigate to Assets -> uMMORPG -> Addons -> RCTestingAddons -> collideOpenPanel ->prefab
2.) Drag the collideOpenPanel(free) prefab to scene (or hierarchy)
3.) Rename to match closely to the panel you want to open, as to make life easier when working with multiple panels and triggers to open them. *not required, just suggested*
4.) size the panel opener in scene to a small to moderate size, this does not need to be big. The tiniest size will work. But, to big may allow player to open panel from incorrect places, like outside the building the anvil is in. Just big enough for player to be able to barely touch
5.) Select the panel opener in hierarchy
6.) drag panel required to open over to the panel openers “Panel” box
7.) turn panel openers sprite renderer off
8.) enjoy
